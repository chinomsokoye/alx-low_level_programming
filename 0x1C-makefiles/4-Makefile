# Build executable file school with the all rule
# The all rule should recompile only the updated files
# Rules: all: builds executable, oclean: deletes the object files
# The clean: delete all EMACS and VIM temp files along with the executable
# The fclean: delete all EMACS and VIM temp files, the executable, and
# the object files
# The re: forces recompilation of all source files
# Variables: CC: compiler to be used, SRC: .c files, OBJ: .o files
# NAME: name of executable, RM: the program files to delete
# CFLAGS: favorite compiler flags: -Wall -Werror- Wextra -pedantic

CC = gcc
